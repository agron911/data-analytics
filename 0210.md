##  Python subclass collections
* 
```py
from collections import UserDict
class Event(UserDict):      #Event is subclass of UserDict
    def __getitem__(self, key):
        value = super().__getitem__(key)
        return f"[{self.__class__.__name__}]: {value}"  #
        
event = Event(user="user", event_type="login", date="2017-07-11")   #{ket:value}
print(event['event_type']) #print(event.__getitem__('event_type'))  
for key, value in event.items():
    print(f"{key} = {value}") #the items() method doesn’t call the Event's __getitem__() 
```

## name a tuple
* (...,...,..) use [0] to get item
* when we build a data struture we can name the column
* it's convinence , just remember the field name and we can find the data
```py
import collections
UserRecord = collections.namedtuple("UserRecord", ('user_id', 'username', 'first_name', 'last_name'))       # think of it as a field name
ur1 = UserRecord(92, 'jsmith', 'John', 'Smith')     # url1 is a tuple
ur2 = UserRecord(93, 'njohnson', 'Nathan', 'Johnson')   # named tuple
print(ur1[1])  #access by index like regular tuple
print(ur1.username)  #access by identifier
print(*ur2) #unpacking
```

## itertools
* goal is to get item by item in sequence. tuple, dict, generator, generator expression..
* use next() in the loop

#### CSV file
* it's important in this field
* use comma to seperate
* we can to excel to create csv file
```py
c://桌面//southeast// data analytics//sp500.py

class DataPoint(namedtuple("DataPoint", ["date", "value"])):    
#cuz it has a lot of fields in it, we only want to use two column in the table
#it's subclass of namedtuple
    __slots__ = ()
#class variable, defined outside the constructor

    def __le__(self, other):    # <=
        return self.value <= other.value

    def __lt__(self, other):    # <
        return self.value < other.value

    def __gt__(self, other):    # >
        return self.value > other.value
# read the cvs file
# and return a DataPoint the yuple
def read_prices(csvfile, _strptime=datetime.strptime):
    with open(csvfile) as infile:   # infile : file io object
        reader = csv.DictReader(infile)
        # get evey data in csv is string **
        for row in reader:  # access line by line
            yield DataPoint(    # generate DataPoint, from datetime module
            # generate the tuple, tuple of tuple, ((),(),(),())
                date=_strptime(row["Date"], "%Y-%m-%d").date(), #change string data to date object
                value=float(row["Adj Close"]),  
            )
```
* difference between yield and  return
* yield
    * it's a generator, can be used as iterators, to retrieve item one by one
    * it's goint to return sequence, not like 'return' will return single  

### Read prices and calculate daily percent change.
```py
prices = tuple(read_prices("C:\\Users\\ziping\\Documents\\Spring2019\\CS433\\datafile\\SP500.csv"))
# read_prices is a generator, so we create a tuple object from generator
gains = tuple(
    DataPoint(day.date, 100 * (day.value / prev_day.value - 1.0))
    for day, prev_day in zip(prices[1:], prices)    #generator express, list comprehension
)

```
### Find maximum daily gain/loss.
```py
zdp = DataPoint(None, 0)  # zero DataPoint
max_gain = ft.reduce(max, it.filterfalse(lambda p: p <= zdp, gains))
# it is iterator, drop all the negative value
# reduce is a function tools, you don't want apply all of the datas, so we list our criteria within our filterfalse function.
max_loss = ft.reduce(min, it.filterfalse(lambda p: p > zdp, gains), zdp)
# max, min implicity use. <=,<,>. Need to use function to override 

```



```py
# we have a lot of data, a lot of gains percentage. 
# try to find all of the consecutive gains , to find the longest-growth-streak
def consecutive_positives(sequence, zero=0):    #sequence is input every day's gain
    def _consecutives():    #generator
        for itr in it.repeat(iter(sequence)):
            yield tuple(
                it.takewhile(
                    lambda p: p > zero, it.dropwhile(lambda p: p <= zero, itr)
                    # the second lambda function is to descripe the dropwhile function
                    # in second lambda meet the first occurence
                )
            )

    return it.takewhile(lambda t: len(t), _consecutives())

growth_streaks = consecutive_positives(gains, zero=DataPoint(None, 0))
#growth_streaks is a generator
longest_streak = ft.reduce(
    lambda x, y: x if len(x) > len(y) else y, growth_streaks
    # reduce(lambda x, y: x if len(x) > len(y) else y, growth_streaks) ->functions
    # growth_streaks is sequence
)
```
